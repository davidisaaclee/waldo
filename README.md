# Waldo - papercut animation toy

I went to the Jim Henson exhibit at the SF Jewish art museum, and I saw a video there that showed someone animating a frame-by-frame sequence by photographing paper shapes on a table. I have a strong attraction to tables simulated by software, so I wrote Waldo to simulate what that kind of animation could be like.

[Try it out here.](http://david-lee.net/waldo/)

1. Drag some shapes to make a single frame. (Touchscreens can pinch to rotate/scale.)
2. Click `Capture to next frame`
3. Move shapes a little more, using the outlines as a guide of where the shapes were in the last frame
4. Click `Capture to next frame` again
5. Continue adding frames
6. Press `Play` to preview the animation
7. Click on the small preview box to fullscreen the preview. Click anywhere in the fullscreen to minimize.
8. To edit a previous frame, click `-1` / `+1` to navigate the preview to it; click `Restore frame` to make the table match the previewed frame; make changes; then click `Replace frame` to replace the previewed frame with the contents of the table.
